# Winter25_CIS579_Chatbot

## This Project is for the course CIS579, Artificial Intelligence, within the University of Michigan - Dearborn Campus
### The project consists of utilizing a Local Large Language Model paired up with sentiment analysis to review prompts given by users and provide relevant answers that may assist users in venting, discussing situations, serve as a friend, and even therapeutic for those in need. The LLM at hand will be below a threshold of 10b parameters to remain within hardware requirements and will be executed in a VSCode Python Environment. 
#### Deliverables include:
1) Recompiling relevant data for LLM + Sentiment Analysis (Psychology+Social field for improved interactions)
2) Selecting LLM+Sentiment Analysis model of choice to generate appropiate responses to project descriptions
3) Set environment in python and packages required to work with models
4) Test the models output to review responses and the efficiency of Sentiment Analysis pairing.
5) Prepare Report + Presentation on Findings
